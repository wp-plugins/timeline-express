By default Timeline Express uses the single-timeline-epxress-announcement.php template file to display all single announcements.

If you would like further control in customizing the template, you can copy the template file 'single-timeline-express-announcement.php' 
(located in /timeline-express/lib/single-announcement-template/single-timeline-express-announcement) into your active theme directory root.

Timeline Express will then load the template file in place of the default one. You can make any adjustments you would like without fear of 
losing your changes on plugin updates.
