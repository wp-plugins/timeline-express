### Frequently Asked Questions

###### How do I use this plugin?
Begin by simply installing the plugin. Once the plugin has been installed, go ahead and begin creating announcement posts. You'll find a new menu item just below 'Posts'.
After you have a substantial number of announcements set up, you're ready to display the timeline on the front end of your site.

Timeline express displays best on full width pages, but is not limited to them. Create a new page, and drop the shortcode into the page - `[timeline-express]`.
Publish your page, and view it on the front end the see your new super sweet timeline! (scroll for animation effects!)

###### What template is the single announcement post using? Can I customize it at all? I want to do x, y or z.
The single announcement post is using a custom template file that comes pre-bundled with the plugin. If you want to customize the template for whatever reason
you can do so, by creating a directory in your active theme called 'timeline-express'. Once the directory is created, simply copy the file titled 'single-timeline-express-announcement.php' into
the newly created 'timeline-express' directory in your theme. Timeline express will then automagically pull in the newly created template in your theme root. You can go ahead and customize 
it to your hearts desire without fear of losing any changes in future updates!

###### Can I create more than one timeline?
At the moment no, but I will consider adding that into a futre update if people show enough interest.

###### At what width are the breakpoints set?
Breakpoints are set at 822px. The timeline will shift/re-adjust automatically using masonry based on the height of each announcement container.

###### How can I translate this plugin?
The text-domain for all gettext functions is `timeline-express`.
